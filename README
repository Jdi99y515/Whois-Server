----- Abstract -----

The official whois server of the RIPE is opensource but there is not a lot of documentation. 
It is particulary complicated to compile and use. 

Th goal of this project is to provide a fully featured Whois Server with redis as backend. 
It will possible to query the server through a redis client but also using the whois protocol. 

--------------------


----- Details -----

The Whois database is fully generated everytime we have a new database.

The querying is actually faster than the official whois server.
